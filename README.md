# Expo CLI Incompatibility Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Expo CLI: incompatibility between the CLI version and certain libraries or features.  The `bug.js` file showcases code that might trigger this error, while `bugSolution.js` provides solutions for resolving it.

**Problem:** Using a library or feature that isn't compatible with the current Expo SDK version or CLI version often leads to cryptic error messages during development or the build process.  This can include issues with native modules, dependencies, and configurations.

**Solutions:**
* **Update Expo CLI and SDK:** Ensure you're using the latest versions of both Expo CLI and the Expo SDK.  Run `expo upgrade` to update your project.
* **Check Library Compatibility:** Verify that all the libraries you're using are compatible with your current Expo SDK version. Refer to their documentation or package.json for compatibility information.
* **Resolve Dependency Conflicts:** Analyze your `package.json` file for conflicting dependencies that may cause unexpected behavior.  Use tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why` to identify and resolve conflicts. 
* **Correct Configuration:** Check your `app.json` and `package.json` for incorrect configurations that might interfere with library or feature integration.
* **Eject (if necessary):** In some rare cases, if you're using a library with significant native dependencies, you might need to eject from managed workflow to a bare workflow.  This is generally a last resort.
