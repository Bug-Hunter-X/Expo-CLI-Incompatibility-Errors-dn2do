The solution often involves updating your Expo CLI and SDK to the latest versions, verifying library compatibility, and resolving any dependency conflicts.  In some cases, carefully reviewing and adjusting configurations within `app.json` and `package.json` may be necessary. If problems persist, consider temporarily removing libraries to pinpoint conflict sources.  Consider consulting the Expo documentation and community forums for further assistance.
