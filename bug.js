This error typically occurs when you're using a library or feature within Expo that isn't fully compatible with the version of Expo CLI you're using. This can be caused by several factors, such as using outdated libraries, conflicting dependencies, or incorrect configurations within your app's `package.json` or `app.json` files.  A common scenario is using a library that depends on a native module that hasn't been properly integrated into your Expo project.
